Getting Started with T-Pot on AWS

Create an AWS Account: If you don't already have one, sign up for an AWS account.

Launch an EC2 Instance:

Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by typing "EC2" in the AWS search bar.
Select the region where you want your T-Pot instance to run.
Configure the EC2 Instance:

Click on Launch Instances to start the setup process.
Choose an AMI: Select Debian 11 Supported Images as your Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Instance Type: Choose t2.xlarge.
Create a Key Pair:

Click on Create a new key pair.
Name your key pair, select RSA for the key type, and choose the .pem format.
Download the key pair to your computer and save it in a secure and easily accessible location.
Network Settings:

Leave the default network settings for now.
Configure Storage:

Set the storage size to 128 GiB. Depending on your requirements, you can adjust this, but it is recommended not to go below 50 GiB.
Resource Requirements:

Ensure you use at least 4 CPUs and 16 GiB of Memory. Using fewer resources may cause the T-Pot Dashboard to lag.
Note: While Debian 12 may initially work, it has been known to cause issues after a few days, such as problems 
logging into T-Pot and Docker containers restarting. Hence, Debian 11 is recommended for stability. After these steps you can now create/launch your instance. 

Connecting to Your EC2 Instance

Verify Instance State:

Ensure that your instance state is running.
Confirm that the instance has passed the 2 status checks.
Connect to Your Instance:

Select your instance by clicking the checkbox next to your instance name.
In the top section, click on Connect.
Choose the SSH client option.
Copy the SSH command provided under the Example section.
SSH into Your Instance:

Use a Linux VM or the Mac Terminal to SSH into your AWS instance.
Ensure you are in the same directory as your key pair file (.pem) when executing the SSH command.
