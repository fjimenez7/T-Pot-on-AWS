Dionaea Honeypot

Overview
Dionaea is a low-interaction honeypot designed to detect and capture malicious events. Its main goal is to emulate vulnerable services to 
attract attackers and analyze their methods, providing valuable insights into attacker techniques.

How Dionaea Works
Dionaea emulates multiple services and protocols, such as SMB, HTTP, FTP, and many more. By presenting these services and protocols, 
it becomes a target for attackers looking to exploit vulnerabilities. When attackers interact with these services, Dionaea records the details of these 
interactions. For example, it captures payloads, logs activities, and provides data that you can query for analysis.

What Dionaea Can Capture
Connection Attempts: Information on who is trying to connect to the honeypot, including IP addresses and ports.
Payloads: Actual data sent by attackers, such as malware or exploit code.
Malware Samples: If an attacker uploads or tries to execute malware, Dionaea captures the sample for further analysis.
Dionaea uses an SQLite database to store logs, making it easy to query. It can also capture network traffic in PCAP format, 
which can be analyzed using Wireshark or similar tools.

Why This is Important
Dionaea provides important information, such as attacker IP addresses and their techniques and methods. Understanding what vulnerabilities are being targeted 
can help organizations prioritize patches. This helps defenders understand emerging threats and attack patterns.

Top Ports Being Hit:

Port 445 (SMB): Server Message Block protocol allows devices to communicate with each other. In the past, attackers have used this port to gain access to 
network devices, such as in the WannaCry attack. Having this port open allows attackers to gather sensitive information about network devices. 
Itâ€™s recommended to disable port 445 in your firewall and use a VPN if access is needed. Ensure you are using the most up-to-date version of SMB for the
latest security protections.
Port 1433: Default TCP port for Microsoft SQL Server instances, used to manage large amounts of data using SQL. Common vulnerabilities include SQL injection. 
Mitigations include sanitizing user input, proper firewall rules, and strong passwords.
Captured Usernames and Passwords:

Usernames:
