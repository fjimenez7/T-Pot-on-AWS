# T-Pot-on-AWS
In this project, I will describe how to set up T-Pot on AWS and share my experience. T-Pot is an open-source honeypot framework that captures and analyzes cyber threats. By deploying T-Pot on AWS, I aim to create a environment for monitoring malicious activities, covering setup, configuration, data analysis, and security.
