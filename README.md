# T-Pot-on-AWS
In this project, I will be describing how to set up T-Pot on AWS and sharing my experience using T-Pot. T-Pot is an open-source honeypot framework that integrates several honeypot daemons and tools for capturing and analyzing cyber threats. By deploying T-Pot on AWS, I aim to create a robust environment for monitoring malicious activities. This project will cover everything from setting up the AWS environment and configuring T-Pot to analyzing captured data and discussing security considerations. Join me as I delve into the world of honeypots and share insights from my journey.
