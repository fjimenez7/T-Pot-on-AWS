T-Pot Dashboard Overview

T-Pot Dashboard is a central interface for interacting with the T-Pot honeypot framework.
It provides a comprehensive view of captured data, like attack details, honeypot status,
and analytical tools. This dashboard is important for monitoring and analyzing malicious
activities collected by various honeypots within T-Pot.

Importance of T-Pot Dashboard:

Centralized Monitoring: T-Pot offers centralized monitoring for all honeypots and their activities.
Real-Time Updates: Provides real-time updates on malicious activities and attack patterns.

Data Analysis: Allows users to analyze attack data to understand threat actors' tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Visualizations: Offers easy-to-digest visual representations of complex attack data in
an understandable format.

Threat Identification: Helps identify new threats based on attack patterns and efforts,
assisting in creating and improving defensive measures against common and emerging threats.

Suricata CVEs:

Count: 4,313 | CVE-2020-11899: "The Treck TCP/IP stack before 6.0.1.66 has an IPv6
Out-of-bounds Read." - cvedetails.com

Count: 667 | CVE-2006-2369: "RealVNC 4.1.1 allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication via a request with an insecure security type such as 'Type 1 - None', which is
accepted even if not offered by the server." - cvedetails.com

Count: 70 | CVE-2019-12263/CVE-2019-12261/CVE-2019-12260/CVE-2019-12255: "This
vulnerability resides in the IPv4 option parsing and may be triggered by IPv4 packets containing
invalid options, potentially leading to remote code execution." - cisa.gov

Count: 51 | CVE-2019-11500/CVE-2019-11500: "In Dovecot before 2.2.36.4 and 2.3.x before
2.3.7.2, protocol processing can fail for quoted strings, leading to out-of-bounds writes and
remote code execution." - nvd.nost.gov
Importance and Impact:

Deploying T-Pot on AWS provides significant advantages for cybersecurity monitoring and research.
The cloud-based deployment ensures scalability, availability, and flexibility, allowing continuous
observation of evolving threat landscapes. By capturing real-world attack data, T-Pot helps
organizations and security professionals understand emerging threats, refine their defensive
strategies, and stay ahead of malicious actors.

This project has not only strengthened my skills in deploying and managing honeypots but also
provided practical experience in analyzing cyber threats. The insights gained from this endeavor
contribute to the broader field of cybersecurity by enhancing our understanding of attacker behavior
and improving our ability to defend against future attacks.

I hope this documentation serves as a useful guide for others looking to deploy T-Pot on AWS and
encourages further exploration and innovation in the field of honeypot-based threat detection.
