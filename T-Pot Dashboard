T-Pot Dashboard Overview

T-Pot Dashboard is a central Dashbaord for interacting with the T-Pot honeypot framework.
It provides a comprehensive view of captured data, like attack details, honeypot status,a and
analytical tools. This dashboard is imporant for monitoring and analyzing malicious activities that are collected
by various honeypots that are within T-Pot.

Importance of T-Pot Dashboard:

T-Pot offers a centralized monitoring for all of T-Pot honeypots and their actvities.
Displays the information in real-time updates on malicious activites and attack patterns.
This allows users to analyze attack data to understand theart actors TTPs. The visualizations 
offer a easy way to diegust all of the information being displayed that represent complex attack data
in a understanble format. 

Being able to collect of this information on atttackers and their TTPs help identify new threats
based on attack patterns and efforts. This will assists in creating and improving defensive measures
against common and emerging threats.

Now we will be going through some of the information collected on my T-Pot Dashboard:

Total HoneyPot Attacks 224,999
Attacks by Honeypot destions: Dionaea, Honeytrap, Cowrie, Redishhoneypot, and Mailoney

Attacks by Country: United States, Russia, India, Egypt, and China
Most attacks were by know attackers 94% and 6% from mass scaners

Attacks by Port destination: 445(SMB), 6379, 23(telnet), 25(SMTP), 22(SSH)

Suricata Alert Category:
Generic Protocol Communcation

Suricata CVE: 

Count: 4,313 | CVE-2020-11899 "The Treck TCP/IP stack before 6.0.1.66 has an IPv6 Out-of-bounds Read." -cvedetails.com

Count: 667 | CVE-2006-2369 "RealVNC 4.1.1, and other products that use RealVNC such as AdderLink IP and Cisco CallManager, 
allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as 
"Type 1 - None", which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server, as originally demonstrated using a long password." -cvedetails.com

Count 70 | CVE-2019-12263/CVE-2019-12261/CVE-2019-12260/CVE-2019-12255 "his vulnerability resides in the IPv4 option parsing and may be triggered by 
IPv4 packets containing invalid options. The most likely outcome of triggering this defect is that the tNet0 task crashes. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution." -cisa.gov

Count 51 | CVE-2019-11500/CVE-2019-11500 "In Dovecot before 2.2.36.4 and 2.3.x before 2.3.7.2 (and Pigeonhole before 0.5.7.2), protocol processing can fail for quoted strings. 
This occurs because '\0' characters are mishandled, and can lead to out-of-bounds writes and remote code execution." -nvd.nost.gov


Importance and Impact:

Deploying T-Pot on AWS provides significant advantages for cybersecurity monitoring and research. The cloud-based deployment ensures scalability, availability, and flexibility, allowing continuous 
observation of evolving threat landscapes. By capturing real-world attack data, T-Pot helps organizations and security professionals understand emerging threats, refine their defensive strategies,
and stay ahead of malicious actors.This project has not only strengthened my skills in deploying and managing honeypots but also provided practical experience in analyzing cyber threats. 
The insights gained from this endeavor contribute to the broader field of cybersecurity by enhancing our understanding of attacker behavior and improving our ability to defend against future attacks.
I hope this documentation serves as a useful guide for others looking to deploy T-Pot on AWS and encourages further exploration and innovation in the field of honeypot-based threat detection.
